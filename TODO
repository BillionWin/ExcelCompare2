* Loop through all sheets to do a proper diff of a workbook (rather than just
first sheet)
* Set up tool to build so can be used as a command line tool
* Figure out how to add dependent libraries without just copying and pasting
from na-ka-na's project
* Deal with whole column / row cell references
* Dates as dates not numbers?
* Decouple diff finding and reporting
* Diff output more like git??
* Detect transformations (e.g. inserting rows, deleting columns, cutting cells
etc.)
* Decouple from POI more: remove dependence from Formula in particular but also
consider CondensedFormulae in time
